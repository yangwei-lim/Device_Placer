# Analog Layout Device Placer

Analog Layout Device Placer is a sub-tool designed for the AutoALG: Automated Analog Layout Generation. 
It utilizes B*-Tree floorplan representation and Simulated Anealing algorithm to efficiently place the generated devices.
This approach optimize the area and wirelength of the analog layout design.
